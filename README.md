Action Launcher API
==================================

A simple API live wallpaper developers can use to allow [Action Launcher 3](2) to theme itself based on the current colors of your wallpaper.

Note: use of this API is only necessary for **live wallpapers** (not status wallpapers). This is due to Android not providing any APIs for apps to fetch Bitmap data about the current live wallpaper.



Usage
=====

1. Integrate the Action 3 API code into the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file:
	
	`compile 'com.actionlauncher:action3-api:1.+'`
  <br><br>If you're not using Android Studio/gradle, you can add the [`action3-api.jar`][5] to your `/libs` folder, or copy the API [code][3] directly into your project.<br><br>


2. Add this code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` (inside the `Application` entry):

    ```
    <service android:name="com.actionlauncher.api.LiveWallpaperSource"
        android:label="LiveWallpaperSource"
        android:exported="true">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.actionlauncher.api.action.LiveWallpaperSource" />
        </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
3. In your application code, you will need a `Bitmap` instance of your live wallpaper. At the point in your code where you have this `Bitmap` instance, add the following:

    ```
    Bitmap myBitmap = ...
    try {
        LiveWallpaperSource.with(context)
            .setBitmapSynchronous(myBitmap)
            .run();
    } catch (OutOfMemoryError outOfMemoryError) {
        // Palette generation was unable to process the Bitmap passed in to
        // setBitmapSynchronous(). Consider using a smaller image.
        // See ActionPalette.DEFAULT_RESIZE_BITMAP_MAX_DIMENSION
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException illegalArgumentEx) {
        // Raised during palette generation. Check your Bitmap.
    } catch (IllegalStateException illegalStateException) {
        // Raised during palette generation. Check your Bitmap.
    }
    ```



<br>To test it all works:
 
 * Load Action Launcher 3 (you *must* be using version 3.3 or later).
* Ensure your wallpaper is set as the live wallpaper.
* Ensure Action Launcher's wallpaper extraction mode is enabled (Settings -> Quicktheme -> Theme -> Wallpaper).
* As you're integrating the API, be sure to turn on Settings -> Help -> Advanced -> Live wallpaper API debug in Action Launcher 3. By doing so, you will enable a debug mode where pressing the voice search button on the search bar will trigger a request to your app for the latest `LiveWallpaperInfo` data.


Demo
====
The `main` app in this repository demonstrates the live wallpaper functionality. It is basically the main app from the [Android Live Wallpaper Hello World project](1). If you double-tap empty space on Action Launcher 3's home screen, the wallpaper image will change, and you items such as the search bar will have their colors updated as per the current wallpaper image in Action Launcher 3.

Check out the `LiveWallpaperSource.with()` call in `MuzeiBlurRenderer.java`.

Notes
=====

* Keep in mind that each time you call `LiveWallpaperSource.setBitmapSynchronous()`, a new palette will be generated. In order to not waste battery, you only want to make this call when you know there has been a meaninful visual change in your wallpaper app and Action Launcher's Quicktheme feature should be updated.
* This API includes a copy of API 22's Palette library from Support Library named `ActionPalette`[4]. It has been integrated directly into the ActionLauncherApi rather than as a dependency because:
 * Many live-wallpaper developers are still using Eclipse, which has seemingly isn't well set up to use AARs.
 * Makes the dependencies easier.
 * It doesn't take much code size, so there's little harm in it.
