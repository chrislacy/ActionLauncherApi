Simple Live Wallpaper Demo
==========================

<img src="screenshot.png" width="300">

A "Hello World" app that can be referened when creating a live wallpaper application for Android.

This app is just a barebones version of Roman Nurki's [Muzei][1] that cycles between a few images included in the APK. Do check out Muzei if you want something more advanced.
